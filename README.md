## Files

    Bouncer.py

The original file in this repository. It gives accurate-seeming data, but off a false premise.
It assumes that parameters can change partway through the experiment.

    Bouncer2.py

An updated version of the original file. This time, only 27 (correct) iterations are calculated.

    Bouncer3.py

Bouncer3 allows the user to select how many values (within the range of uncertainty) to calculate with, e.g. 'take 100 values within the window 36 +- 0.5.' The nimber of values can be set at the top of the file.
